# Smart-Sorting_Transfer-Learning-for-Identifying-Rotten-Fruits-and-Vegetables

Smart Sorting is an AI-powered web app that is capable of detecting fruits and vegetables that are fresh or rotten. Food wastage is a major problem in food processing plants, supermarkets, and even our households in the modern world. This is where this project comes into play using the power of deep learning and computer vision. 

Transfer Learning with VGG16, a powerful pre-trained deep learning model forms the system’s architecture. The dataset for training the model consisted of 28 classes of fruits and vegetables, in fresh and rotten conditions. It was done on Google Colab using GPU for faster results. 

The web application is developed using Python and Flask, and it has a minimalist and responsive user interface. The user only needs to upload an image of any fruit or vegetable and the system instantly predicts whether the fruit or vegetable is fresh or rotten, with a confidence score and the top 3 predictions. 

There are several industry applications for the technology it produces. Its application is in food processing plants, where it can automate the sorting process on conveyor belts, eliminating human errors and cutting labor costs. In supermarkets, it can scan shipments that arrive at supermarkets before sending them to the shelves for sale. In smart homes, it is able to monitor the condition of stored food inside refrigerators, and warn the users before food is wasted. 

The aim of this project is to capitalize on the cutting-edge developments in artificial intelligence and deep learning to accelerate, intelligentize, and democratize the process of food quality detection.
